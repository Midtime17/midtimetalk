Stop, sit down and relax because it’s time for our  **\#ClassicWednesday**

Today we are talking about a book that everyone should read, is a short “children book” but it’s really meant for adults, have any idea of what I’m talking about?

Of course, it’s the little prince, this is a book that you can read at any stage in your life and still find a different meaning to it.

Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, publish this book in 1943 while he was in the U.S. and tells us the story of a little boy that leaves the safety of his planet and begins to explore the universe, during that time he encounters many adventures and even makes a few friends, among them a pilot that got stranded in the Sahara Desert who acts as the narrator of this story.

The reason that we choose this book as one of the classic you must read is because during the curse of the book you can experience how society has shape us to often forget what is important, we grow up and tend to forget what really matter as the fox says to the little prince in an occasion

**"M_en have no more time to understand anything. They buy things all ready made at the shops. But there is no shop anywhere where one can buy friendship, and so men have no friends anymore" _**

But believe me you won’t really get it until you read the book, it has so many ways of make you think about how you have been living and what you think is important, it makes you feel familiar but yet it never stops being captivating.

This book touches so many aspects that will make you amazed that is cataloged as a children book, if we use our imagination and get a bit mystic about it we can also see it as the journey of his life, and the many encounters are just moments that made a special change on how he sees life.

I want to add one of my favorites quotes on this book because I found it extremely valuable.

_**"To me, you are still nothing more than a little boy who is just like a hundred thousand other little boys. And I have no need of you. And you, on your part, have no need of me. To you, I am nothing more than a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes. But if you tame me, then we shall need each other. To me, you will be unique in all the world. To you, I shall be unique in all the world..."**_

If you do decide to read this book all I ask is that you use your creativity, imagine things as if you were the little prince and be a kid who is experiencing the universe for the first time. This way, you will find some of the reasons why this book never stopped being a classic.

A plus side of this book is that is so short is can really be a light reading, don’t forget to let us know what you think below.
